    <h1>Introductory Questions - Victoria Cheung</h1>
    
    <ol> 
        <li>Hi, my name is Victoria and I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science.</li>
        <li>I wanted to take this class to pursue my minor in HCI. In addition, since my background in computer science is mostly front-end focused, I would love the opportunity to learn how to incorporate user-interaction and design concepts into my work.</li>
        <li>Yes, in coursework and in personal projects, I have coded a few websites and web-apps using HTML, CSS and JS.</li>
        <li>I hope to learn how to effectively plan the layout of my website depending on its purpose.</li>
        <li>I expect that the biggest difference between designing for paper and designing for the screen would be static design as apposed to interactive design, as users are able to experience a variety of different interactions with a screen.</li>
        <li>This <a href="https://www.audemarspiguet.com/com/en/collections/code-11-59.html">Audemars Piguet</a> website has a stunning design- it has an immersive scrolling experience that's visually striking without feeling overwhelming. The minimalistic details on the website also exemplify the luxury watch brand very well.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/">Airbnb's</a> website does effective communication really well. The visual hierarchy and placing of interactive elements on the website makes sense, and information for each airbnb listing is very cleanly presented.</li>
        <li>I think that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify's</a> website works really well, especially in terms of its purpose. Though the design is on the simpler side, the layout is clean and effectively structured, and the interactive elements are easy to find and intuitive to use.</li>
    </ol>
