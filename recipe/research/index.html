        <h1>Japanese Curry</h1>
        <p>Description: A delicious and comforting Japanese dish with a unique blend of spices. Curry rice, or kare rice (pronounced  karē raisu), is a dish that was brought to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) from the British, when India was under colonial rule. It was served to the Japanese Imperial Navy to prevent thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency and became popular across Japan in the 1960s when curry made its appearance in restaurants and supermarkets.</p>
