        <h1>Japanese Curry</h1>
        <p>Description: A delicious and comforting Japanese dish with a unique blend of spices. Curry rice, or kare rice (pronounced  karē raisu), is a dish that was brought to Japan during the Meiji era (1868–1912) from the British, when India was under colonial rule. It was served to the Japanese Imperial Navy to prevent thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency and became popular across Japan in the 1960s when curry made its appearance in restaurants and supermarkets.</p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <br>
            <section class="ingredients">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Curry roux cubes (1):</strong> the ratio of roux to water is 1 cube : 150 ml water. Add an additional tablespoon of water if you like a thinner consistency.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protein:</strong> I use soy curls for a vegetarian/vegan alternative, however you can use your protein of choice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vegetables:</strong> The most standard vegetables added to Japanese curry are onions, potatoes, carrots and mushrooms. However, feel free to use other vegetables like peppers, kabocha, sugar snap peas, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans or okra.</li>
                    <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Adds richness to the curry. Use dairy-free butter as needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Japanese Worcester or Fruit & Vegetable sauce:</strong> this adds sourness to balance out the sweet-savory taste of the curry. You may substitute this with ketchup or vinegar.</li>
                  </ul>
