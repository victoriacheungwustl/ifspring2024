                <p>I'm on the run with you, my sweet love<br>
                    There's nothing wrong contemplating God<br>
                    Under the chemtrails over the country club<br>
                    Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool<br>
                    Me and my sister just playing it cool<br>
                    Under the chemtrails over the country club<br> 
                    <br> 
                    Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels<br>
                    Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools<br>
                    Baby, what's your sign?<br>
                    My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun<br>
                    You won't play, you're no fun<br>
                    Well, I don't care what they think<br>
                    Drag racing my little red sports car<br>
                    I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild<br>
                    <br>
                    I'm on the run with you, my sweet love<br>
                    There's nothing wrong contemplating God<br>
                    Under the chemtrails over the country club<br>
                    Wearing our jewels in the swimming pool<br>
                    Me and my sister just playing it cool<br>
                    Under the chemtrails over the country club<br>
                    <br>
                    Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools<br>
                    We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool<br>
                    It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me<br>
                    I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild<br>
                    <br> 
                    You're in the wind, I'm in the water<br>
                    Nobody's son, nobody's daughter<br>
                    Watching the chemtrails over the country club<br>
                    Suburbia, The Brentwood Market<br>
                    What to do next? Maybe we'll love it<br>
                    White picket chemtrails over the country club<br>
                    <br>
                    My love, my love<br>
                    <br>
                    Washing my hair, doing the laundry<br>
                    Late-night TV, I want you only<br>
                    Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs<br>
                    It's never too late, baby, so don't give up<br>
                    It's never too late, baby, so don't give up<br>
                    Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah (you're born in December and I'm born in June)<br>
                    You're born in December and I'm born in June (under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah)<br>
                    <br>
                    My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon<br>
                    My Cancer is sun and my Leo is moon</p>
