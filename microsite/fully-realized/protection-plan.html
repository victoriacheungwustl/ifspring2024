            <h1>Protection and preservation: Reef 2050 plan</h1>
            <div class="textbox">
                <p>In March 2015, the Australian and Queensland's governments formed a plan for the protection and preservation of the reef's universal heritage until 2050. This 35 years plan, titled "Reef 2050 Plan" is a document proposing possible measures for the long-term management of the pollution, climate change and other issues that threaten the life span and value of this global heritage. The plan contains all the elements for measurement and improvements, including; long-term sustainability plan, water quality improvement plan and the investment plan for the protection and preservation of The Reef until 2050.[97]</p>
                <p>However, whereas the 2050 plan aims to incorporate protective measures such as improving water quality, reef restoration, killing of predatory starfish, it does not incorporate additional measures to address what may be the root cause the problem – climate change, which is caused by greenhouse gas emissions. As such, experts doubted whether it would be enough to save the fragile environment.[69][98][99] Another issue is that the time left to the 1.5 °C warming threshold (the temperature limit that coral reefs can still cope with[100]) is very limited.[101]</p>
                <p>As part of the Reef 2050 plan, an AUD$443 million grant was given to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in 2018. The announcement of the grant was subject to backlash as the grant had avoided proper tender and transparency processes.</p>
                <h2>Conservation Policy: Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan</h2>
                <p>The Great Barrier Reef contributes to the overall wellbeing of the marine biome.[102] Numerous species of aquatic plants, fish and megafauna use the reef for feeding, shelter and mating.[103] Threats such as ocean acidification, pollution runoff and outbreaks of destructive species like the crown-of-thorns starfish have brought about the decline of this ecosystem.[104] These threats to the reef are not only a danger to the organisms inhabiting it, but also the economy of this region, a large part of which relies on revenue from ecotourism of the Great Barrier Reef.[105</p>
                <p>The Australian government has had the goal of protecting this World Heritage Site since 1972 when they created The Australian Institute of Marine Science.[106] The Australian and Queensland governments have contributed about $142.5 million to their National Environmental Science Program which is how they've collected much of their data regarding threats to the Great Barrier Reef.[106] In addition, the Reef 2050 Water Quality Improvement Plan was announced in 2018 in order to help transition local communities, agricultural organizations and industries to more sustainable practices.[107] This plan will join the Queensland government and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to manage the amounts of runoff that reach the Great Barrier Reef as well as mitigating crown-of-thorns starfish population flare-ups.[107]</p>
