    <h1>What is the Great Barrier Reef?</h1>
    <p>The Great Barrier Reef supports an extraordinary diversity of life, including many vulnerable or endangered
      species, some of which may be endemic to the reef system.[43][44]. Thirty species of cetaceans have been recorded
      in the Great Barrier Reef, including the dwarf minke whale, Indo-Pacific humpback dolphin, and the humpback whale.
      Large populations of dugongs live there.[44][45][46] More than 1,500 fish species live on the reef, including the
      clownfish, red bass, red-throat emperor, and several species of snapper and coral trout.[45] Forty-nine species
      mass spawn, while eighty-four other species spawn elsewhere in their range.[47] Seventeen species of sea snake
      live on the Great Barrier Reef in warm waters up to 50 metres (160 ft) deep and are more common in the southern
      than in the northern section. None found in the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area are endemic, nor are any
      endangered.</p>
    <p>A large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of
      human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff
      of manmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic
      population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish.</p>
    <p>The Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander
      peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular
      destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important
      economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$3 billion per year.[15] In November 2014, Google launched
      Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef.[16]</p>
    <p>A March 2016 report stated that coral bleaching was more widespread than previously thought, seriously affecting
      the northern parts of the reef as a result of warming ocean temperatures.[17] In October 2016, Outside published
      an obituary for the reef;[18] the article was criticised for being premature and hindering efforts to bolster the
      resilience of the reef.[19] In March 2017, the journal Nature published a paper showing that huge sections of an
      800-kilometre (500 mi) stretch in the northern part of the reef had died in the course of 2016 of high water
      temperatures, an event that the authors put down to the effects of global climate change.[20] The percentage of
      baby corals being born on the Great Barrier Reef dropped drastically in 2018 and scientists are describing it as
      the early stage of a "huge natural selection event unfolding". Many of the mature breeding adults died in the
      bleaching events of 2016–17, leading to low coral birth rates. The types of corals that reproduced also changed,
      leading to a "long-term reorganisation of the reef ecosystem if the trend continues."[21]</p>
    <p>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 (section 54) stipulates an Outlook Report on the Reef's health,
      pressures, and future every five years. The last report was published in 2019.[22] In March 2022, another mass
      bleaching event has been confirmed, which raised further concerns about the future of this reef system, especially
      when considering the possible effects of El Niño weather phenomenon.[23]
    <p>The Australian Institute of Marine Science conducts annual surveys of the Great Barrier Reef's status, and the
      2022 report showed the greatest recovery in 36 years. It is mainly due to the regrowth of two-thirds of the reef
      by the fast-growing Acropora coral, which is the dominant coral there.[24]</p>
